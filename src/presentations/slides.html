		<em>Abstract</em>
		<p>Functional programming seems like a fad these days, many languagues are adding features from category theory and other erudite traditions, even Java has added lambda's, streams and optionals. But these ideas are neither new nor a fad, and many of them had seeds in Java from the beginning.</p>

		<em>Description</em>
		<p>"We were not out to win over the Lisp programmers; we were after the C++ programmers. We managed to drag a lot of them about halfway to Lisp." - Guy Steele, co-author of the Java specification. In this talk, we will explore how functional styles can be applied to Java to create better object oriented designs, and how recent additions to Java expedite these patterns. In addition we will look at other JVM languages that have more direct roots in the lambda calculus with better support for algebraic and categorical desgn patterns. We will also discuss how these functional styles can enhance correctness with tools such as monoids, phantom types, trampolines, and algebraic data types and how to represent these constructs in Java.</p>

	<h1>Question: How do you write a big a program?</h1>
	<h1 data-reveal="a">Answer: By combining smaller programs.</h1>
	<h2 data-reveal="b">In other words - programs are built by composition from smaller programs.</h2>
	<h2 data-reveal="c">Ideally, ways of composing programs should preserve properties of those smaller programs.</h2>
	<h2 data-reveal="d">One interesting property is "correctness".</h2>

	<h1>Mathematical Functions</h1>
	<blockquote>
		<p>A function is a relation that uniquely associates members of one set with members of another set. More formally, a function from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> is an object <code>f</code> such that every <code>a</code> in <code>A</code> is uniquely associated with an object <code>f(a)</code> in <code>B</code>.</p>

	<h1>A brief historical digression</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>1903 - Bertrand Russell creates a mathematical type system to resolve paradoxes in his set theory.</li>
		<li>1933 - Kurt Goedel defines General Recursive functions</li>
		<li>1936 - Alonzo Church creates the Lambda Calculus</li>
		<li>1936 - Alan Turing created Turing Machines (including the Universal Turing Machine)</li>
		<li>All of these mechanisms of defining "Computable Functions" are equivalent.</li>
		<li><strong>The Church Turing Thesis is the statement that these defintions are equivalent to the informal notion of an "effectively calculable functions".</strong></li>
		<li>1934/1969 - Haskell Curry and William Howard connect logic and typed functions in the lambda calculus with eponymous Curry-Howard correspondance.</li>
		<li>1958 - John McCarthy created the programming language Lisp and based it directly on Church's Lambda Calculus for it's semantic model.</li>
		<li>1972 - Per Martin-L&ouml;f creates Intuitionist Type Theory as a constructivist foundation for Mathematics (carrying on in the tradition of Russell).</li>
		<li>1972/1974 - John Reynolds and Jean-Yves Girard create the polymorphic lambda calculus (System F) extending the power of existing type theories.</li>
		<li>1973 - ML (Meta Language) was created by Robin Milner. Originally created to be used as a proof assistant.</li>

<div class="slide">
	<h1>So what is Functional Programming and what does all that have to do with it?</h1>
	<h3 data-reveal="a">1977 - John Backus (of Algol fame, and the "B" in BNF) receives a Turing Award and delivers an address titled...</h3>
	<h1 data-reveal="b">Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs.</h1>
	<blockquote data-reveal="c"><p>An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.</p>

	<p>Associated with the functional style of programming is an <strong>algebra of programs</strong> whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. <strong>Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.</strong></p>

	<h1>Functional Programming (according to Emily)</h1>
	<blockquote data-reveal="a">Functional Programming is a <strong>school of research</strong> that studies what is computable, <strong>how to express those computations</strong>(the theory of programming languages) and <strong>reasoning about combinations of computations</strong> using mathematics, in particular <strong>Abstract Algebra, Category Theory, Constructivist (Intuitionistic) Mathematics, and the Lambda Calculus</strong>.</blockquote>

<h1>A story about functional thinking</h1>
<blockquote><p>The venerable master Qc Na was walking with his student, Anton.  Hoping to prompt the master into a discussion, Anton said "Master, I have heard that objects are a very good thing - is this true?"  Qc Na looked pityingly at his student and replied, "Foolish pupil - objects are merely a poor man's closures."</p>

<p>Chastised, Anton took his leave from his master and returned to his cell, intent on studying closures.  He carefully read the entire "Lambda: The Ultimate..." series of papers and its cousins, and implemented a small Scheme interpreter with a closure-based object system.  He learned much, and looked forward to informing his master of his progress.</p>

<p>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by saying "Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand that objects are truly a poor man's closures."  Qc Na responded by hitting Anton with his stick, saying "When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's object."  At that moment, Anton became enlightened.</p>

	<blockquote data-reveal="a"><p>What would we like our children- the general public of the future--to learn about computer science in schools? We need to do away with the myth that computer science is about computers. Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes, biology is about microscopes or chemistry is about beakers and test tubes. Science is not about tools, it is about how we use them and what we find out when we do.</p>
